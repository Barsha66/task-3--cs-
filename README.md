# Description
This project provides a Python-based tool to assess the strength of a password based on various security criteria. It evaluates factors such as length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, then categorizes the password’s strength accordingly. The program also provides specific feedback to help users understand areas where their password could be improved.

# Features
Password Strength Levels: Categorizes password strength into five levels—Very Weak, Weak, Moderate, Strong, and Very Strong.
Criteria-Based Feedback: Checks each password against specific security criteria and provides detailed feedback.
Clear Visual Indicators: Uses simple checkmarks and cross symbols to indicate which criteria are met, making feedback user-friendly.
Customizable Criteria: The tool can be extended or modified to include additional checks as needed.

# Usage
Enter Password: Input a password you wish to evaluate.
View Strength and Feedback: The program will categorize the password’s strength and display feedback on which criteria were met.
Adjust Password if Needed: Based on the feedback provided, users can improve their password and recheck its strength.

# Example
For a password that meets all criteria (length, uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character), the tool will label it as "Very Strong." If it meets only a few criteria, it may be classified as "Weak" or "Very Weak."
